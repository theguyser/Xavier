# Xavier The Explorer

Xavier The Explorer is now available to download and play!
The game is playable from start to finish!*
There might be some bugs not caught during playtesting.

In Xavier The Explorer, you play as Xavier, encountering activities related to MOBILITY in his life. For example, organizing traffic jams, giving seats to those in need while on the bus, and walking to the supermarket.

There are 3 kinds of levels:

Road Organization
Conversations on the Bus
Running to a destination
Xavier will become an informed citizen on how mobility affects everyone and learn independence.

The game was made thanks to:
- Lam Hoang Lanâ€‹ for being the Team Leader and coding the game with me
- Le Cat Tuong (Jun Ly) for writing the narrative
- Nguyen Huynh Nam for working on 3D Models and prototype running level
- Tran Phuong Anh for 2D Sprites and Backgrounds
- Myself for coding and bug-testing the majority of the game
